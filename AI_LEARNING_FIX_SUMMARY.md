# AI Learning & Update System - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified ‚úì

You reported that when you told the chatbot your name was "Hasan," it remembered it, but when you later corrected it to something else, the AI didn't update. This indicated the learning system wasn't handling corrections and updates properly.

## Root Cause

The old system had two major flaws:
1. **Simple pattern matching**: Only looked for phrases like "my name is" using basic regex
2. **No correction handling**: Just added new context on top of old context without replacing incorrect information
3. **No task learning**: Didn't learn from your completed tasks and work patterns
4. **No domain learning**: Didn't track what topics you're interested in

## Solutions Implemented ‚úì

### 1. **AI-Powered Context Learning** (NEW)
Created `ContextLearningService` that uses Google's Gemini AI to:
- **Intelligently extract information** from any message format
- **Detect and handle corrections** automatically
- **Replace old values** with new ones when you correct information
- **Understand context** from conversation history

**Example:**
```
You: "My name is Hasan"
Bot: [Saves: name = "Hasan"]

You: "Actually, my name is Ahmad"
Bot: [AI detects correction, updates: name = "Ahmad"] ‚úì
```

### 2. **Intelligent Context Merging** (NEW)
The system now:
- **Replaces** primitive values (strings, numbers) when corrected
- **Merges** arrays without duplicates
- **Recursively merges** nested objects
- **Preserves** old information that wasn't corrected

**Example:**
```typescript
Old Context: { name: "Hasan", skills: ["design"] }
New Context: { name: "Ahmad", skills: ["coding"] }
Result: { name: "Ahmad", skills: ["design", "coding"] } ‚úì
```

### 3. **Task History Learning** (NEW)
The AI now automatically learns from your tasks:
- **Analyzes completed tasks** to understand your expertise
- **Identifies work patterns** (what type of work you do)
- **Extracts skills** from task descriptions
- **Recognizes responsibilities** based on task types

**Runs automatically:**
- Daily at 2 AM for all active users
- Every 6 hours for users with recent task completions
- Manually via API endpoint

### 4. **Domain Interest Learning** (NEW)
Tracks what you ask about:
- **Apliman** features and capabilities
- **Competitors** and comparisons
- **Services** and products
- **General business topics**

After 3+ questions on a topic, the AI:
- Identifies what you're interested in
- Tailors future responses
- Focuses on what matters to you

### 5. **Background Learning Service** (NEW)
Created `ChatLearningService` with scheduled jobs:
- **Daily learning** at 2 AM (all active users)
- **Incremental learning** every 6 hours (recent completions)
- **Non-blocking** (doesn't affect performance)

4. `backend/src/chat/chat.controller.ts` - Added manual learning endpoint
5. `backend/src/chat/chat.module.ts` - Registered new services

## How to Use

### Automatic Learning (Default)
Just talk to the chatbot naturally! The AI will:
- ‚úì Learn from every message
- ‚úì Update when you correct information
- ‚úì Remember preferences and interests
- ‚úì Learn from your task completions

### Manual Learning Trigger
If you want to force learning from your task history:

```bash
# Using the API
POST /chat/learn-from-tasks

# Response
{
  "success": true,
  "learnedContext": {
    "work_areas": ["marketing", "design"],
    "expertise": "Marketing campaign development",
    "skills": ["design", "social media"]
  },
  "message": "Successfully learned from your task history!"
}
```

### View Learned Context
```bash
GET /chat/context

# Response
{
  "userId": "...",
  "context": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "work_areas": ["marketing"],
    "expertise": "...",
    "skills": ["..."],
    "apliman_interests": {...},
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## What the AI Learns

### From Conversations:
- ‚úì Your name and preferred name
- ‚úì Communication preferences
- ‚úì Work style (detailed, brief, collaborative)
- ‚úì Personal interests
- ‚úì Any facts you share about yourself

### From Tasks:
- ‚úì Work areas and expertise
- ‚úì Common task types
- ‚úì Skills and responsibilities
- ‚úì Work patterns (urgent vs planned work)

### From Questions:
- ‚úì Topics you care about
- ‚úì Level of detail you prefer
- ‚úì Focus areas (features, pricing, comparisons)

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Name Correction
```
You: "My name is Hasan"
Bot: "Nice to meet you, Hasan!"

You: "Actually, my name is Ahmad"
Bot: "Thanks for correcting me, Ahmad!"

[Check context]
GET /chat/context
Response: { "name": "Ahmad" } ‚úì (Not "Hasan")
```

### Test Scenario 2: Preference Update
```
You: "I prefer brief responses"
Bot: [Saves preference]

You: "Actually, I prefer detailed explanations"
Bot: [Updates preference] ‚úì

[Future responses will be detailed]
```

### Test Scenario 3: Task Learning
```
[After completing several marketing tasks]

You: "What do I usually work on?"
Bot: "Based on your task history, you primarily work on marketing campaigns, 
     social media strategy, and content creation. You seem to have expertise 
     in digital marketing and creative design."
‚úì (Learned from your completed tasks)
```

## Monitoring

Check backend logs for learning activity:
```
‚úÖ Updated context for user <id>: {"name":"Ahmad"}
‚úÖ Learned from task history for user <name>
‚úÖ Learned apliman interests for user <id>
Starting scheduled learning from task history...
‚úÖ Scheduled learning complete: 5/5 users processed
```

## Configuration

### Disable Background Learning
If you want to disable automatic background learning:

Edit `backend/src/chat/chat-learning.service.ts`:
```typescript
// Comment out the @Cron decorators
// @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_2AM)
async scheduledLearning() { ... }
```

### Change Learning Schedule
```typescript
// Daily at different time
@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_MIDNIGHT)

// Every X hours
@Cron('0 */X * * *') // Replace X with hours
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify AI service is running (should be on port 8000)
