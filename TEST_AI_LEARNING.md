# Testing the AI Learning System

## Quick Test Guide

### Test 1: Basic Name Correction âœ“

**Steps:**
1. Open ApliChat in the application
2. Send: `"My name is Hasan"`
3. Bot should respond acknowledging the name
4. Send: `"Actually, my name is Ahmad"`
5. Bot should correct itself and use "Ahmad"

**Verify:**
- Check backend logs for: `âœ… Updated context for user`
- Call API: `GET /chat/context` and verify `name: "Ahmad"` (not "Hasan")

---

### Test 2: Multiple Corrections âœ“

**Steps:**
1. Send: `"I prefer brief responses"`
2. Send: `"Actually, I prefer detailed explanations"`
3. Send: `"Can you tell me about Apliman?"`

**Expected:**
- Bot should give a detailed response (not brief)
- Context should show: `preferences: "detailed explanations"`

---

### Test 3: Task History Learning âœ“

**Prerequisites:**
- Have at least 2-3 completed tasks in the system

**Steps:**
1. Call API: `POST /chat/learn-from-tasks`
2. Check response for `learnedContext`
3. Ask bot: `"What do you know about my work?"`

**Expected:**
- Bot should mention your work areas based on completed tasks
- Bot should describe your expertise

---

### Test 4: Domain Interest Learning âœ“

**Steps:**
1. Ask: `"What features does Apliman have?"`
2. Ask: `"How does Apliman compare to competitors?"`
3. Ask: `"What are Apliman's pricing options?"`
4. Check backend logs for: `âœ… Learned apliman interests`

**Expected:**
- After 3 questions, system learns you're interested in features/pricing
- Future Apliman questions get more detailed responses about these topics

---

### Test 5: Background Learning âœ“

**Verify Setup:**
1. Check that `ChatLearningService` is registered in `chat.module.ts`
2. Check backend logs on startup for scheduler registration
3. Wait for scheduled time or manually trigger

**Expected Logs:**
```
Starting scheduled learning from task history...
âœ… Learned from user John's task history
âœ… Scheduled learning complete: X/X users processed
```

---

## API Test Endpoints

### 1. Get User Context
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/chat/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Trigger Manual Learning
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/learn-from-tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Send Chat Message
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "My name is Ahmad",
    "sessionId": null
  }'
```

## Verification Checklist

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] Backend is running (`npm run start:dev`)
- [ ] AI service is running (port 8000)
- [ ] GOOGLE_API_KEY is configured
- [ ] AI_SERVICE_URL is set correctly
- [ ] Database is accessible
- [ ] You're logged in to the application

---

## Expected Behavior

### âœ“ Corrections Work
- Old values are replaced with new ones
- Not accumulated (no "Hasan and Ahmad")
- Immediate effect in next response

### âœ“ Arrays Merge
- Skills: ["design"] + ["coding"] = ["design", "coding"]
- No duplicates
- Preserves both old and new

### âœ“ Objects Merge
```json
Old: { "preferences": { "theme": "dark" } }
New: { "preferences": { "style": "detailed" } }
Result: { "preferences": { "theme": "dark", "style": "detailed" } }
```

### âœ“ Learning Happens
- Every message is analyzed
- Context updates logged
- Persistent across sessions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not learning
**Check:**
1. Backend logs for errors
2. AI service is accessible: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
3. Context endpoint returns data: `GET /chat/context`

### Corrections not working
**Check:**
1. Look for log: `âœ… Updated context for user`
2. Verify AI service returned `learnedContext`
3. Check context directly via API

### Background learning not running
**Check:**
1. ScheduleModule imported in app.module.ts
2. Backend logs show scheduler registration
3. Time is correct (scheduler uses server time)

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Name corrections work**
   - Update immediately
   - Old name not used anymore

âœ… **Task learning works**
   - Extracts expertise from completed tasks
   - Bot references your work in responses

âœ… **Domain learning works**
   - Tracks questions by topic
   - Tailors responses to interests

âœ… **Background learning works**
   - Scheduled jobs run
   - Multiple users processed
   - Logs show success

## Manual Test Script

Run these commands in order and verify results:

```bash
# 1. Check AI service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 2. Login and get token (replace with your credentials)
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpassword"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# 3. Get initial context
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/chat/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. Send message with name
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"My name is Hasan","sessionId":null}'

# 5. Check context (should show name: "Hasan")
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/chat/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 6. Correct the name
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Actually, my name is Ahmad","sessionId":null}'

# 7. Verify correction (should show name: "Ahmad", not "Hasan")
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/chat/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.context.name'
# Expected output: "Ahmad"

# 8. Trigger task learning
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/learn-from-tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 9. Check updated context (should have work_areas, expertise, skills)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/chat/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.context'
```

## Performance Notes

- Each learning operation takes 1-3 seconds (AI processing)
- Background learning doesn't affect user experience
- Context updates are immediate after learning
- Scheduled jobs have built-in delays to avoid overload

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. âœ… Verify all tests pass
2. âœ… Check logs for any errors
3. âœ… Test with real user scenarios
4. âœ… Monitor background learning jobs
5. âœ… Review learned context for accuracy

If all tests pass, the system is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
