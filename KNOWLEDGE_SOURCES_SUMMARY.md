# Knowledge Sources Feature - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Knowledge Sources system that enhances Gemini AI's content generation capabilities for Apliman marketing tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer âœ…
- **New `KnowledgeSource` model** in Prisma schema
- Stores multiple URLs (both Apliman and competitor sources)
- Tracks scraping status, content, errors, and metadata
- Supports priority levels and active/inactive states
- **Migration created and applied**

### 2. Web Scraping Service âœ…
- **Python service** (`ai-service/services/web_scraper.py`)
- Extracts clean text content from websites
- Removes scripts, navigation, and non-content elements
- Captures metadata (title, description, keywords)
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging
- Supports concurrent scraping of multiple URLs

### 3. Backend API âœ…
- **Full CRUD API** for knowledge sources
- Admin-only endpoints for management
- Automatic scraping on create/update
- Manual re-scraping capability
- Bulk scraping for all sources
- Integrated with existing auth/roles system

**Endpoints:**
```
GET    /knowledge-sources          - List all sources
GET    /knowledge-sources/active   - Get active sources
GET    /knowledge-sources/:id      - Get single source
POST   /knowledge-sources          - Create source
PUT    /knowledge-sources/:id      - Update source
DELETE /knowledge-sources/:id      - Delete source
POST   /knowledge-sources/:id/scrape      - Scrape single
POST   /knowledge-sources/scrape-all      - Scrape all
```

### 4. Enhanced AI Content Generation âœ…
- **Automatic knowledge integration** - All content generation now includes:
  - Apliman knowledge base from multiple sources
  - Competitive analysis from competitor URLs
  - Strategic positioning insights
  
- **Smart prompting:**
  - Apliman sources: Up to 3000 chars each
  - Competitor sources: Up to 2000 chars each
  - Prioritized by priority level (1-5)
  - Only active sources are used

- **Works across all AI features:**
  - Task description generation
  - Task goals generation
  - Subtask generation
  - Priority analysis

### 5. Frontend Admin Interface âœ…
- **Beautiful, intuitive UI** at `/admin/knowledge-sources`
- **Features:**
  - View all knowledge sources with status indicators
  - Add new sources (Apliman or Competitor)
  - Edit existing sources
  - Delete sources
  - Enable/disable sources
  - Set priority levels (1-5)
  - Manual scraping with visual feedback
  - Bulk scraping with progress reporting
  - Error display and troubleshooting
  - Last scraped timestamps
  - Content length indicators
  
- **Navigation:** Added to admin sidebar (Admin/Super Admin only)

### 6. Competitive Analysis Logic âœ…
- **Intelligent comparison:**
  - AI analyzes competitor content
  - Identifies Apliman's advantages
  - Highlights unique value propositions
  - Subtle positioning without direct attacks
  - Focus on business outcomes and differentiation
