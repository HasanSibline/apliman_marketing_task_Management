## If Shell Doesn't Work - Use Manual Deploy

1. Render Dashboard â†’ `taskmanagement-backendv2`
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** dropdown
3. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
4. Wait 3-4 minutes
5. Test again

## After It Works

The startup script will handle this automatically on future deploys.
But for now, we need to fix the current running instance.

**I'm watching for your response - let me know if the shell commands work!**
