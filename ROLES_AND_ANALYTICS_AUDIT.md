# Roles and Analytics Implementation Audit

## User Roles

The application has **3 distinct roles**:

### 1. SUPER_ADMIN
- **Full system access**
- Can manage all users (create, edit, delete)
- Can view all analytics (dashboard, team, individual users)
- Can approve/reject tasks
- Can initialize analytics for all users
- Can export tasks to Excel
- Can access debug endpoints

### 2. ADMIN
- **Management access**
- Can manage EMPLOYEE users only (cannot manage other admins or super admins)
- Can view dashboard and team analytics
- Can view individual user analytics
- Can approve/reject tasks
- Can export tasks to Excel

### 3. EMPLOYEE
- **Limited access**
- Can only view their own analytics
- Can create tasks (pending approval)
- Can view and update assigned tasks
- Cannot access team or dashboard analytics
- Cannot manage other users

## Analytics Endpoints & Access Control

### ✅ FIXED ISSUES

#### Route Order Issue (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: The route `GET /analytics/user/me` was never reached because `GET /analytics/user/:userId` matched first.

**Solution**: Reordered routes - specific routes (`/user/me`) now come before parameterized routes (`/user/:userId`).

### Analytics Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Access | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `/analytics/dashboard` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN | Dashboard statistics |
| `/analytics/user/me` | GET | ALL (authenticated) | Current user's analytics |
| `/analytics/user/:userId` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN | Specific user analytics by ID |
| `/analytics/team` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN | Team-wide analytics |
| `/analytics/tasks` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN | Task analytics |
| `/analytics/export/tasks` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN | Export tasks to Excel |
| `/analytics/initialize` | POST | SUPER_ADMIN | Initialize analytics for all users |
| `/analytics/debug/users` | GET | SUPER_ADMIN | Debug: List all users |
