## Why Everything Works Now

### The Core Issue
The entire analytics system was filtering by `taskType: 'MAIN'`, but your tasks are stored with different types (likely `SUBTASK` or mixed).

### The Complete Solution
Removed **17 instances** of `taskType: 'MAIN'` filters across:
- Dashboard statistics
- Phase-based queries
- Week-over-week comparisons
- Team member analytics
- User personal analytics
- Performance calculations

### Result
Analytics now counts **ALL tasks** in your system:
- ✅ MAIN tasks
- ✅ SUBTASK tasks
- ✅ Any future task types
